Hereby basically implementations of amounts, currency and roundings are provided.\r\nYou can access the RI by adding the following maven dependenceies:\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.javamoney</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>jsr-354-ri</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.7</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNevertheless we highly recommend you to depend on the Javamoney OSS library to be used, due to the following reasons:\r\n* the RI only contains a very small, minimalistic subset of features. The JavaMoney project contains additional important features, such as currency conversion, currency management and rounding and formatting faatures.\r\n\r\ntbd...\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
